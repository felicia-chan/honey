<h3>Visualization 1:</h3>
<div> Choice of color scheme: We choose a honey color to go with our theme of honey production.
    We also added some opacity so it would be easier to see how many points are grouped up in the bottom corner.
</div>
<div> Marks and Channels: The marks are dots. The channels are vertical and horizontal position.

    <h3>Visualization 2:</h3>
    <div> Choice of color scheme: We went with our honey color again to keep the theme consistent. 
        In this case the marks are also large so it is better to not have an intrusive color.
    </div>
    <div> Marks and Channels: The marks are lines. The channels are vertical length
        and horizontal

<div>
    <h3>Visualization 3:</h3>
    <div> Choice of color scheme: The colors chosen for 2012, 2005, and 1998 are respectively purple, orange, and blue. 
        We chose these colors as they are distinct from one another and do not interfere with red-green colorblindness, as blue/purple and orange are easily distinguishable from one another. The colors are also more muted due to the graph having larger area marks, and therefore we wanted the colors to be lower-saturated so as not to be as much as an eyesore.
        This specific color scheme was chosen to account for people with color blindness, 
        as there is no red-green confusion found in the colors.
    </div>
    <div> Marks and Channels: The marks for this plot are vertical stacks of lines, channels are vertical lengths and horizontal positions as well as colors and spatial region.

    <h3>Visualization 4:</h3>
    <div> Choice of color scheme: We chose a range of colors that are distinct enough to allow diffrentiating the years apart.
    </div>
    <div> Marks and Channels: The marks are lines. The channels are vertical length, horizontal position, and color/vertical positon for group.

    <h3>Visualization 5:</h3>
    <div> Choice of color scheme: We chose a honey color to go with our theme of honey production. It is also a color that is easy on the eyes.
    </div>
    <div> Marks and Channels: The marks are lines (box area is based off quartile lines so its a line). The channels are the vertical position of all the marks.
